(Chapter 28)[https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/28.pdf] of
Jurafsky and Martin is an overview of Question Answering, with various
citations to various approaches to various sub-modules of QA.  See
something interesting?  Lookup the cited paper and see if you can
reproduce some aspect of what they did.  If you do, cite that paper in
your writeup and presentation.

(Chapter 2 of Xuchen Yao's
thesis)[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/dissertations/xuchen-yao-thesis.pdf]
is another source for similar material to the above, written from the
perspective of someone that did something like this final project,
over multiple years (and then went to successfully build a company and
sell it to Baidu: he knows how to get stuff done, so maybe his thesis
has some nice tips?).
