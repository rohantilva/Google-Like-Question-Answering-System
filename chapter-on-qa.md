(Chapter 28)[https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/28.pdf] of
Jurafsky and Martin is an overview of Question Answering, with various
citations to various approaches to various sub-modules of QA.  See
something interesting?  Lookup the cited paper and see if you can
reproduce some aspect of what they did.  If you do, cite that paper in
your writeup and presentation.

(Chapter 2 of Xuchen Yao's
thesis)[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/dissertations/xuchen-yao-thesis.pdf]
is another source for similar material to the above, written from the
perspective of someone that did something like this final project,
over multiple years (and then went to successfully build a company and
sell it to Baidu: he knows how to get stuff done, so maybe his thesis
has some nice tips?).

(DNNs)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1632.pdf] are the new norm in
sentence classification.  The space of models in this direction is
vast, and outside the scope of the background of most people in the
class.  However if you'd like to pursue this style of approach, this
article is a good place to start, and then look it up in Google
Scholar, seeing which are the most popular articles that cite it, and
iterate in this fashion to do a literature review.  If you decide to
pursue this path please contact the instructors before spending too
much time on it, so we can ensure it is scoped properly (and that you
aren't effectively just downloading a pretrained model for this task).
